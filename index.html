<p>Websites with custom domains are still inaccessible for normal people.</p>

<p>You have to be a half wizard to do it yourself: buy a domain, set up DNS records, create and host the page somewhere. For sure, the barrier to entry has gotten down dramatically with proliferation of services like Squarespace and similar.</p>

<p>But still. The barrier is way too high. With 3B internet citizens, we need all of these 3B people unleash their creativity and create their own pieces of the net.</p>

<p>So let’s take a leap forward - together:</p>

<ul>
<li>Just like YO enabled everyone to YO anyone.</li>
<li>Just like Snapchat enabled everyone to send pictures of their private parts privately.</li>
<li>Just like Ello enabled everyone to not be a product.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Just like that, PIIICO enables everyone to claim their own spot of the internet.</strong></p>

<p>We thought internet was created for everyone. We believe in internet of inclusion, not exclusion. Everyone deserves a place of their own on the internet - not just the privileged elite, the self-proclaimed group of “geeks”.</p>

<p>That’s why we created PIIICO. </p>

<p>Welcome, dear citizen of the internet. Claim your PIIICO today.</p>
