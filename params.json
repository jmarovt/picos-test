{"name":"PIIICO","tagline":"Welcome to PIIICO. This is our Manifesto.","body":"Websites with custom domains are still inaccessible for normal people.\r\n\r\nYou have to be a half wizard to do it yourself: buy a domain, set up DNS records, create and host the page somewhere. For sure, the barrier to entry has gotten down dramatically with proliferation of services like Squarespace and similar.\r\n\r\nBut still. The barrier is way too high. With 3B internet citizens, we need all of these 3B people to unleash their creativity and claim their own pieces of the net. (Their PIIICOs.)\r\n\r\nSo let’s take a leap forward - together:\r\n\r\n- Just like YO enabled everyone to YO anyone.\r\n- Just like Snapchat enabled everyone to send pictures of their private parts privately.\r\n- Just like Ello enabled everyone to not be a product.\r\n\r\n__Just like that, PIIICO enables everyone to claim their own spot of the internet.__\r\n\r\nWe thought internet was created for everyone. We believe in internet of inclusion, not exclusion. Everyone deserves a place of their own on the internet - not just the privileged elite, the self-proclaimed group of “geeks”.\r\n\r\nThat’s why we created PIIICO. \r\n\r\nWelcome, dear citizen of the internet. Claim your PIIICO today.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
